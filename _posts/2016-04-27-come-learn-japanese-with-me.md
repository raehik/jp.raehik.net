**こんにちは！！** Welcome to the first post on my new Japanese
learning/progress blog! This is a long post, so if you don't want to read the
boring story bits, skip ahead to [next][]. Otherwise, let me start you off with
a story...


<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The story so far</h2>

Just shy of 2 years ago, for whatever reason I found myself interested in the
Japanese language and I started to learn the hiragana using [Anki][], a spaced
repetition flashcard program I had a lot of experience with from before. At the
same time I started listening to a lot more music, and a lot of it ended up
being Vocaloid and other Japanese stuff (along with game soundtracks and some
random groups).

So over a year or so, I learned all the hiragana and most of the katakana along
with. I dabbled with Japanese media and learning materials, and loved to read
Khatzumoto's posts on [AJATT][] (MIA on his blog, though there have been AJATT
Plus emails about new sentence packs recently). But I made certain never to
**commit**. Because a lot of the help you can find around the interwebs suggests
that learning another language takes an *awful lot of time*. Being your average
procrastinating student, I never considered myself to have much of that
available. With all the work I did, however, I managed to give myself a great
base for learning Japanese actively. Not sure how much of that was deliberate,
but let's not deliberate :)

Recently I picked up a PS3 for free due to a stroke of luck. I went ahead and
bought an Atelier game since I'd been interested in the series and found that
you can choose to hear the Japanese voice acting. Something clicked and I
realised, "I could learn kanji while playing games like this!" So I sat down
with my laptop and every now and then Googled a word I was able to make out. I
picked up normal stuff like 「城 castle」 and 「仕事 work」 as well as more
'exotic' words such as 「錬金術 alchemy」.

I didn't play too far into it, because Dota 2 takes precedence over all other
games and I found that importing 初音ミクProject Diva wasn't too expensive. That
helped me out with some common game-y words like 「戻る return/go back」. And
finally, I reached my current stage.

With all this prior slow & steady work, I'm quite certain saying that I enjoy
learning Japanese! I'm at a level where I can listen to and read things and even
though I can't understand meaning, I can understand words and phrases and repeat
them. I can recognise all of the kana with decent speed, and I keep Japanese
things all around me digitally so I don't fall out of practice. Plus I've found
a winning Anki strategy, where I create my own cards rather than using someone
else's!

Now I'm learning steadily, and I want to share my experiences and generally
spend time writing in or about Japanese. So welcome, イラシャイマセ！ And I hope
you enjoy my musings :)
