Yesterday I read up a bit on [/r/learnjapanese][learn-jp] about the standard for
how much text in a passage should be in kanji (i.e. what percentage should be in
kanji). I never considered it before, but if you use kanji for every little
thing then it can seem weird or hard to understand. I don't have any examples,
but I'm unsure about the usage of 「ところで」 over 「所で」. Forgot the others
:)

When I was starting with Japanese I found some podcasts from Khatz's blog. I
ended up listening to lots of 「まりもえお！」 but never understood more than
the occasional word or simple phrase. Though it did teach me that Japanese
people can talk very fast @\_@

When I was starting my studying proper a couple weeks ago I decided to [Google
for gaming podcasts][geemu-gg] and found a cool one named 「gdx2ゲームらじお」.
They talk about games and films I know -- and play cute Vocaloid music often!!
Listening to [episode 239](http://gdgdgame.seesaa.net/article/430127489.html)
there's one part where someone is pausing on a thought or something, and someone
says 「はや！」. Is that a contraction of 「はやく quickly」? What other common
contractions are there? *(Eheh, I know as of 2016-04-28 there are no comments on
this blog, but feel free to contact me over email or on Twitter!)*

Edit: Ah, there's also 「知らん」 which Google aptly translates as "dunno", and
I'm guessing 「分からん」 which I'm assuming is a shortening of 「分からない」.
