Still listening to gdx2らじお, who are still talking solely about Mad Max and
Love Live!, lol. I had written down a note a while ago to find out what the
phrase 「あったかい」 meant, and I heard it in episode 237 or 238. Turns out
it's a contraction for the awkward word 「<ruby>暖<rt>あたた</rt>かい</ruby>
warm」.

Learning a particularly weird kanji at the moment:
「<ruby>前<rt>まえ</rt></ruby> before; the past; in front/ahead」. It's hard to
apply a story to and it has lots of random uses. Like, what does it mean in
「お前」 and 「<ruby>名<rt>な</rt>前<rt>まえ</rt></ruby>」? I can understand
「前々から for a long time」 (lit.  からsince + 前々before before), but not
those ones. And I don't grok the usage of 「お前」, since Wiktionary said it
might be vulgar. Maybe they mean it's just informal or 'mate'-y.

Let it be said that numbers in Japanese are easy. I have nightmares from French
KS3 when we learned that 80 is '60 plus 20' and 154 was probably '20 times 8
minus 6'. In Japanese you just go left to right and **read the numbers**. Not
sure if it's the same as English but it sure seems simple, maybe more so.

Upgraded my JP input knowledge! Didn't realise you could straight up use
`<ruby>` tags. Now my Anki cards look swanky and I can use a more consistent
format for showing a word+furigana+translation. My current 日本語 Anki deck
consists of 9 assorted decks, with a total of almost 400 cards. There's a bit
more than 200 words total, with maybe 30 kanji by themselves. I have all the
kana and random phrases filling the rest.

And finally, WTF is the difference between 「猫」 and 「描」. *(That's a
statement, not a question.)*
