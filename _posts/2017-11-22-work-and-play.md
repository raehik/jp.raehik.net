それは今日のゲームである。That's the name of the game. I'm at uni supervising
homework club at the minute (私も宿題があるけど), I'm doing some Japanese study,
thought I could update my Japanese blog for the first time in about 20 months.

I'm playing a lot of video games recently, in Japanese. I try to read out loud,
comment on things, laugh and react with characters.
けっこう面白いです。「勉強です」って素直に言ってわかんないだけど。（ちょっと文法がひどいからスマン）
I started with Ace Attorney 逆転裁判, and am now on the second game, on to cases
I've not played before. But I was HYPED for the Japanese release of VA-11
Hall-A! It came out a few days ago, and I planned to play it again in Japanese
(I already had 39 hours playing through it twice in English).

It's very confusing >\_< I can understand new words and kanji quickly, but
grammar is just dumb. 文法難しいですからね。Still fun and educational enough to
have another go or two. But man, I literally got through *less than a day* after
2 hours of playing
([tweet](https://twitter.com/raehik/status/933158770745602049)):

  > this lmao

So work (study) has become play (games)! Isn't that wonderful? I'm looking at my
Anki deck at least once a week as well. I've been SUPER freaking busy for the
past two weeks and I don't think it'll calm down until after this weekend. I
haven't gone to Jiu Jitsu for a week and a half, and I'm not going
tonight. 本当にざんねんです。でも宿題を頑張ります！（可能）

嫌味（いやみ）sarcasm

「ちょっと、これは大変な問題だ。嫌味をしねぇよ。」  
Hey, this is a serious issue. Cut the sarcasm.
