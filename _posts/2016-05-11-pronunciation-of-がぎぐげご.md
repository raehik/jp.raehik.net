Here's something that's taken me way too long to pick up. The way you
pronounce 'g' sounds in Japanese changes depending on **where it comes in a
word**. For example, if you say 「ゴール goal」, you pronounce it with a hard
'go', using your tongue like you're pronouncing か・き・く・け・こ.  But when
saying 「<ruby>笑顔<rt>えがお</rt></ruby> smile」, you pronounce the が as a
nasal 'nga'.

Taken me ages! I realised it today and was confused for a bit, then episode 3 of
NHK やさひい日本語 went over it as if they had read my mind!

Now I'm picking up on it a lot more. Still not perfect at listening, but I'm
sure I can fix that over time by listening to the plethora of ポッドキャスト and
radio shows around.
