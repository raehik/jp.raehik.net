Hiya, and welcome to **raehik learns Japanese**, my Japanese language learning
blog (or rather, 日本語ブログ)! This blog shall tell the ongoing story of how I
learned/am learning/will learn Japanese.

At some point, I'll get a better or more fitting theme for this website. Until
then I guess you're all going to have to deal with the Jekyll default >:)
